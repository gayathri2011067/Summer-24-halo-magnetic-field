<h2>TO-DO</h2>

- 2014 paper in fortran:
  - [x] algebraic quenching
  - [ ] dynamic quenching
- Implement different numerical methods:
  - [x] forward
  - [x] backward
  - [x] central
- reading:
  - [ ] beck et al review paper
  - [x] br93 paper,"vertical magnetic field above the disc of spiral galaxies"
  

  
  <h2>PROGRESS</h2>

  - Derivation of the formulas for numerical methods
  - Implemented three methods
  - read br93 paper
  - Implemented algebraic quenching
  
  <h2>REMARKS</h2>
  
  - Trouble compiling in fortran, learning it.
  - Difficulty implementing other schemes: like Crank-Nicolson.
  - Some other troubles with fortran.
  - Did not implement dynamic quenching.
  - Did not finish review paper.
